## my language :
|  language  | mastery (personnal /10) | difficulty (personal, /10) | avantage(personnal)                                                                                                        | disaventage (personnal)                                                                                                      | case of use                                                  |
|:----------:|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| python     | 8️⃣    | 4️⃣                  | easy to learn, fast to use, package manager, and the best communitie ive seen                                   | cannot be compiled                                                                                               | back-end, scripting and learning (for human or machine ;) )  |
| C          | 7️⃣    | 8️⃣                  | fast, compiled, mother(or father dont know) of almost all the modern language , and good documentations          | old, slow to learn and you will need to code almost from scratch                                                 | only your imagination (and time) can stop you                |
| CPP        | 6️⃣    | 8️⃣                  | same as C but with Object and a bunch of useful things, and good documentations                                  | take a lot of time like C (a lil better)                                                                         | same as C but without the time                               |
| rust       | 2️⃣    | 🔟                 | compiled, fast, completed, new (inspired by C), usable on all system for all purpose and have a package manager | too much keyword, **REALY DIFFICULT** and a lack of communitie and documentations                                                                         | same as C, but with reduce time (if you manage to master it) |
| javascript | 5️⃣    | 2️⃣                  | work in browser and realy easy to learn                                                                         | js is like a car, which pollutes a lot and is optimised for browser (this is why chrome use almost all your RAM) | website (realtime, animation, etc)                           |
